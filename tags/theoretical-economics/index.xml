      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my university days, we had a course named &amp;lsquo;Finance and Financial Management&amp;rsquo;, delivered by a former investment banker. Unsurprisingly, it was heavily oversubscribed (I studied maths in London), and any students landing a seat can count themselves very fortunate indeed. Rather less fortunately, half way through the first lecture, I wanted nothing better than to walk out the door.
