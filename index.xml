      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a blog like this one, here&amp;rsquo;s how to do it. I&amp;rsquo;m also noting it down for my own use, in case I need to replicate my setup again. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s straightforward enough that anyone new to it (like me) can quickly be effective with it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;no free lunch&amp;rsquo; (NFL) theorem resembles the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) from &lt;a href=&#34;zaowudata.science/2018/05/the-inverse-part-i-why-theres-always-arbitrage-.../&#34;&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt; in that their true values lies in exactly the opposite of what they say at face value. The folk version of the NFL says that that no algorithm or optimisation technique will perform any better for all cases. Effectively, that there is no silver bullet or &amp;lsquo;algorithmic arbitrage&amp;rsquo; that will magically solve all your needs. This theorem is frequently used to justify further fine-tuning on models.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my university days, we had a course named &amp;lsquo;Finance and Financial Management&amp;rsquo;, delivered by a former investment banker. Unsurprisingly, it was heavily oversubscribed (I studied maths in London), and any students landing a seat can count themselves very fortunate indeed. Rather less fortunately, half way through the first lecture, I wanted nothing better than to walk out the door.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Glad to see you here. You&amp;rsquo;re in the right spot if you&amp;rsquo;ve come to look for a spot of mental stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
